This site was generated using `Jekyll v{{ jekyll.version }}` with the `master` branch of `jekyll-locale` repository, and has been
deployed at [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).

Site design is an adaptation of the [Official Jekyll Documentation site](https://jekyllrb.com) and is maintained by the plugin
author.
The background texture was downloaded from: [Subtle Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/tactile-noise/).
